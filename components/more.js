        content: "Verb tenses are changes or additions to verbs to show when the action took place: in the past, present, or future. The phrase verb tense is also used for grammatical aspects, which add more details about the duration or time an action takes. When you combine the four grammatical aspects with the past, present and future, you end up with twelve main verb tenses in English. Verb tenses are essential for speaking English correctly, but with all the different forms and functions, they can get confusing. In this guide, we give a quick overview of the English tenses, including when to use them and how to make them, and give plenty of verb tense examples."

        content: "Verb tenses show when an action took place, as well as how long it occurred. The main verb tenses are the past, present, and future. There are also additional aspects that give extra details, such as the length of time the action occurred, which actions happened first, or whether a past action has an impact on the present. These grammatical aspects are the simple tense, perfect tense, continuous tense, and perfect continuous tense. "

        h5: "Verb tenses list: How many tenses are there in English?",
        content: " The standard tense in English is the present tense, which is usually just the root form of the verb. The past and future tenses often require changes or additions to the root form, such as the suffix –ed for the past tense and the modal verb will for the future. However, for each of the past, present, and future tenses, there are four different aspects that add additional details. For example, the continuous tense shows that an action is ongoing. It can be used in the present (she is sleeping), past (she was sleeping), or future (she will be sleeping). "

        title: "Simple tense",
        content: "  The simple tense is a grammatical aspect that refers to the normal forms of the past, present, and future tenses—nothing fancy! Unlike the other aspects, it doesn’t add any new information. True to its name, simple tenses are the easiest to form and have the fewest rules."

    {
        title: "Perfect tense",
        content: "The definition of the perfect tense is a little more complicated. It’s used for actions that relate to other points in time, either completed or ongoing. For example, in the sentence I have played soccer since I was a child, the perfect tense indicates that the action occurred continuously in the past and still happens in the present. By contrast, in the sentence I played soccer when I was a child, the simple past tense indicates that the action occurred only in the past, and has no relation to the present.The perfect tenses use a conjugation of the auxiliary verb have with the past participle of the main verb.

        title: "Continuous tense ",
        content: " We use the continuous tenses (also known as the progressive tenses) for ongoing actions or actions that happen a while before completion. For example, They are studying all night means the studying lasts many hours before it’s finished. Please note that you usually do not use the continuous tense with stative verbs like want, love, have, and need. The continuous tenses use a conjugation of the auxiliary verb be along with the main verb’s present participle, or –ing form. "

        content: "When you combine the perfect and continuous tenses, you get the perfect continuous tense. It’s typically used just like the perfect tense, except it describes ongoing actions that happen over a period of time. The construction of the perfect continuous tense uses a conjugation of the auxiliary verb have, the auxiliary verb been (the past participle of be), and the present participle of the main verb.  "

    {
        title: "Past tenses",
        content: " Simple past We use the simple past to show actions completed in the past, with no extra emphasis. For regular verbs, you form the simple past tense by adding the suffix –ed to the end of the verb (or just –d if the past tense verb already ends in an e). Be careful of irregular past tense verbs, however. These don’t follow the normal rules and use their own unique forms for the past tense. For example, the past tense of the irregular verb go is went. Regular verbs: I picked up the glass, but it dropped from my hand. Irregular verbs: This morning I went to the store, but I forgot the milk. "

My dog was whimpering in his sleep when the TV woke him up. As kids, my friends and I were always getting into trouble. "

Often the simple present is just the root verb with no changes or additions. The main exception to this is when the subject is third person and singular. In this case you add the suffix –s. If the verb ends in o, ch, sh, th, ss, gh, or z, you add –es. If the verb ends in a consonant and y (and the subject is third-person singular), drop the y and add –ies.
